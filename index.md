## GEOL 1021 Infographic assignment!

The interesting site I have chosen for my infographic assignment are the Galapagos Islands. I have chosen this as my site because it is a famous tourist attraction from my home country, Ecuador. The Galapagos Islands are located about 1000 km away from the continent of South America and contain about 19 large islands, according to the UNESCO website. The Galapagos Islands are home to many interesting sites such as the Charles Darwin Research Station, volcanoes like the Wolf or Cerro Azul, and unique species such as the giant tortoise or large diversity of birds and iguanas.

# About Galapagos

Formed by the eruption of volcanoes. These Islands mostly consist of single volcanos that erupted to form these land masses whose shape are dependent on the volcanic activity. The most interesting one is Island Isabela since it was formed by six volcanos, therefore it is the larges of all the islands. The Galapagos islands are on the Nezca tectonic plate, which is slowly drifting eastward. The easternmost islands are the oldest which explains the low volcanic activity found there, while the westernmost islands still have volcanic activity and are considered to still be forming.

## Isabela
This is the largest island measuring 120 km and is also the youngest. A northern location served as shelter for sea farers such as pirates and whalers. Colonization focused more on resource extraction rather than human settlement, what started as a small mining operations or plantations evolved into towns which ended up reaching a population of 1749 in 2006. 

The island was formed by multiple volcanoes. Isabela island has the most volcanic activity than the other islands. Isabela island is home to the Sierra Negra volcano which allows visitors to see thousand-year-old sulfur crystals and walk near recent lava flows. Furthermore, there are many other wonderful views and sites that tell the story of how the whole archipelago was formed. In Isabela island one can also see the tortoises at the Tortoise Center, which house the endangered giant tortoises found only in the Galapagos islands.

The Sierra Negra volcano is a shield volcano and is considered one of the most active volcanos along with Cerro Azul and Wolf.

## Spañola
The southernmost island in the archipelago. This island houses the two most interesting visitor sites. Since it is such an isolated island, it is home to many exotic species such as the Española lava lizard. The Spañola Island is a shield volcano. The Spañola Island is mostly known for rescuing the Española giant tortoise from sure extinction. Thanks to the effort of many, the tortoises are now thriving and available for the world to see.

**Lava Lizards** 
 vary in color depending on the island they are from. Their color depends on how dark the lava from their home island is, and they are also able to detach their tail to escape from predators and regrow it after some time. How cool is that?

## Wolf
Named after the German geologist Theodor Wolf, this island is uninhabited by people. The Island is visited by curious divers that want to see exotic marine life like the Great Spotted Whale Shark. The Wolf and Darwin volcanos can be found here, and are dated as far back as 400, 000 to 1.6 million years old. Inland, sea birds frequent the island, and the most interesting one being the vampire finch.

These plankton eating giants can be found in the diver site known as El Derrumbe, which translates to the collapse. Alongside Hammerhead and other marine wildlife.

This small bird is one of the most interesting sea birds found in Wolf Island. Because of the very dry conditions in the area the vampire finch began to drink the blood of other animals to survive. These birds feed on eggs and other birds to secure moisture. Their main source of blood is from another bid named Red-footed Boobie. The vampire finches peck the boobie until blood is drawn and then drink it. Furthermore, the boobie seems to not be harmed by their feeding which makes it weird, but I am sure it is at least uncomfortable. 


## Isla Pinta

This shield volcano is most famous for being home of Lonesome George. Lonesome George was the last known Pinta tortoise in the world. Found by a researcher while observing snails, Lonesome George was brought to the Tortoise Center on Santa Cruz. Many attempts were made to produce offspring to restore the population of Pinta Tortoises. The main cause for the disappearance of the Punta tortoise is their use as food from sea travelers and destruction of their habitat by goats. Goats were released into Pinta island and quickly reproduced causing destruction to the ecosystem of the island. The goats were eradicated, and the fauna has started to recover. This is an example of how destructive humans can be, and how we need to think of the ecosystem we live in when making decisions.

# Conservation

Considerable efforts are made by many to keep the integrity of the Galapagos islands many different ecosystems. Previous colonization has caused the harm to the environment which has taken many years to restore. The introduction of invasive species such as pigs, goats and fire ants are a threat to the wildlife present in these islands. Furthermore, unregulated fishing and pollution are threatening marine life similarly. The Galapagos National Park carries out many restorative, invasive species eradication, and protection projects throughout the area. 

# Conclusion

The Galapagos Islands are an amazing, breathtaking, and mesmerizing world site. It is an example of what we are as Humans. Shaped by the environment many species have adapted to live in these conditions by changing their behavior. We have recognized the threats to this site int time and are now working on restoring it to avoid more permanent loses, like Lonesome George. It is a good start to repairing the harm we have caused in this world, now we only need to apply it everywhere else. The information presented here is only but a fraction of what the Galapagos Islands have to offer. Below are the references I used to build this site and they can be used to continue on reading about this world wonder.
